A home security system based on Arduino is a do-it-yourself (DIY) security solution that utilizes the Arduino platform for creating a customizable and cost-effective system to protect a home. 
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that consists of a microcontroller and a development environment, allowing users to build and program their electronic projects.
WHY ARE HOME SECURITY SYSTEMS IMPORTANT?
Cost-Effective: Affordable compared to commercial systems.
Customizable: Tailored to specific needs and easily adaptable
DIY Approach: Empowering users to build and own their security systems.
Educational: Provides learning opportunities in electronics and programming
Flexible and Scalable: Can start with a basic setup and expand as needed
